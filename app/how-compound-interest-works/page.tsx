        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Is Compound Interest?</h2>

        <p>
          Hey there! Ever heard the saying "make your money work for you"? That's exactly what compound interest does.
          Unlike simple interest, which only pays interest on your initial investment, compound interest pays you
          interest on your interest. It's like getting a bonus on top of a bonus!
        </p>

        <p>
          Think of it this way: When you put $1,000 in a savings account with 5% annual interest, you'll earn $50 after
          the first year. With simple interest, you'd keep earning $50 each year. But with compound interest, in the
          second year, you earn 5% on $1,050 (your original $1,000 plus the $50 interest), which gives you $52.50. Each
          year, your interest grows because you're earning interest on a larger amount.
        </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Magic Formula</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">The basic compound interest formula is:</p>
          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-md text-center">
            <p className="font-mono text-lg">A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)</p>
          </div>
          <ul className="mt-4 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>A</strong> = Final amount
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>P</strong> = Principal (initial investment)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>r</strong> = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>n</strong> = Number of times interest is compounded per year
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>t</strong> = Time in years
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Compound Interest Is So Powerful</h2>

        <p>
          Albert Einstein supposedly called compound interest the "eighth wonder of the world," saying, "He who
          understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it." Whether Einstein actually said this is debated, but the
          point stands: compound interest is incredibly powerful.
        </p>

        <p>
          The real magic of compound interest happens over time. In the short term, the difference between simple and
          compound interest might not seem huge. But give it 10, 20, or 30 years, and the gap becomes massive. This is
          why starting to invest early is so important â€“ you're giving compound interest more time to work its magic.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How to Use Our Compound Interest Calculator</h2>

        <p>
          Our <strong>compound interest calculator</strong> is designed to be super easy to use while giving you
          powerful insights into how your money can grow. Here's a quick guide on how to use it:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Enter Your Initial Investment</h3>

        <p>
          Start by entering how much money you're planning to invest right now. This is your principal amount. Our{" "}
          <strong>compound interest calculator with currency selection</strong> lets you choose from 10 major world
          currencies, so you can calculate in your preferred currency.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Set Your Interest Rate</h3>

        <p>
          Enter the annual interest rate you expect to earn. This could be the rate from a savings account, CD, bond, or
          the expected return from stocks or other investments. Not sure what rate to use? Here are some common ranges:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Savings accounts: 0.5% - 2%</li>
          <li>Certificates of deposit: 1% - 4%</li>
          <li>Government bonds: 2% - 5%</li>
          <li>Corporate bonds: 3% - 7%</li>
          <li>Stock market (average historical): 7% - 10%</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Choose Your Compound Frequency</h3>

        <p>
          Our <strong>compound interest calculator with different compounding frequencies</strong> lets you select how
          often interest is calculated and added to your principal. Options include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Daily (365 times per year)</li>
          <li>Weekly (52 times per year)</li>
          <li>Bi-weekly (26 times per year)</li>
          <li>Monthly (12 times per year)</li>
          <li>Quarterly (4 times per year)</li>
          <li>Half-yearly (2 times per year)</li>
          <li>Yearly (1 time per year)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          More frequent compounding leads to slightly higher returns. For example, daily compounding at 5% will yield
          more than yearly compounding at the same rate.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Set Your Timeline</h3>

        <p>
          Our <strong>compound interest calculator with timeline customization</strong> allows you to specify exactly
          how long you plan to keep your money invested. Enter the number of years and months to see how your investment
          will grow over that specific period.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Add Regular Contributions (Optional)</h3>

        <p>
          Want to see how adding money regularly affects your growth? Our{" "}
          <strong>compound interest calculator with regular deposits</strong> lets you enter an amount you plan to
          contribute on a regular basis. You can choose to make these deposits monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or
          yearly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regular contributions can dramatically increase your final balance. Even small monthly deposits add up
          significantly over time thanks to compound interest.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Plan for Withdrawals (Optional)</h3>

        <p>
          If you're planning to take money out regularly, our{" "}
          <strong>compound interest calculator with withdrawals</strong> has you covered. Enter how much you plan to
          withdraw and how often. This is perfect for retirement planning or when you need income from your investments.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. View Your Results</h3>

        <p>After entering your information, our calculator will show you detailed results including:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Final balance</li>
          <li>Total interest earned</li>
          <li>Total deposits made (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Total withdrawals taken (if applicable)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Our <strong>compound interest calculator with yearly breakdown</strong> also provides a detailed table showing
          how your balance grows each year, making it easy to track your progress over time.
        </p>

        <div className="my-8 p-6 border rounded-md bg-primary/5">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Real-World Example</h3>
          <p>
            Let's say you invest $10,000 with an 8% annual return, compounded monthly, and you add $200 every month for
            20 years.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Initial investment:</strong> $10,000
            <br />
            <strong>Monthly contribution:</strong> $200
            <br />
            <strong>Annual interest rate:</strong> 8%
            <br />
            <strong>Compounding frequency:</strong> Monthly
            <br />
            <strong>Time period:</strong> 20 years
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Final balance:</strong> $150,775
            <br />
            <strong>Total contributions:</strong> $58,000 ($10,000 initial + $48,000 in monthly deposits)
            <br />
            <strong>Total interest earned:</strong> $92,775
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            That's the power of compound interest â€“ your money more than doubled through interest alone!
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Impact of Different Variables</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Interest Rate</h3>

        <p>
          Even small differences in interest rates can lead to huge differences in your final balance over long periods.
          Our <strong>compound interest calculator with variable interest rates</strong> lets you experiment with
          different rates to see how they affect your results.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, a $10,000 investment at 5% for 30 years will grow to about $43,219. The same investment at 7%
          will grow to $76,123 â€“ a difference of over $32,000 just from a 2% higher rate!
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Additional Contributions</h3>

        <p>
          Regular contributions dramatically accelerate your growth. Our{" "}
          <strong>investment calculator with deposits and withdrawals</strong> shows you exactly how much impact your
          regular savings can have.
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, investing $10,000 at 7% for 30 years gives you $76,123. But if you add just $100 per month
          during that time, your final balance jumps to $186,187 â€“ more than double!
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Time</h3>

        <p>
          Time is perhaps the most powerful factor in compound interest. The longer your money compounds, the more
          dramatic the growth becomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider this: $10,000 invested at 7% for 10 years grows to about $19,672. The same investment for 30 years
          grows to $76,123, and for 40 years it reaches $149,745. The extra years make an enormous difference!
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Questions About Compound Interest</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How often should I compound my interest?</h3>

        <p>
          Generally, more frequent compounding is better for you as an investor. However, the difference between daily
          and monthly compounding is usually small. What matters more is the interest rate and how long you keep your
          money invested.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Is compound interest good for loans?</h3>

        <p>
          When you're borrowing money, compound interest works against you. This is especially true for high-interest
          debt like credit cards. If you only make minimum payments, compound interest can cause your debt to grow
          rapidly.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What investments use compound interest?</h3>

        <p>Many investments benefit from compound interest or compound returns, including:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Savings accounts</li>
          <li>Certificates of deposit (CDs)</li>
          <li>Bonds (when interest is reinvested)</li>
          <li>Dividend-paying stocks (when dividends are reinvested)</li>
          <li>Mutual funds and ETFs (when distributions are reinvested)</li>
          <li>Real estate investment trusts (REITs) with dividend reinvestment plans</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tips for Maximizing Compound Interest</h2>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 my-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Start early.</strong> The sooner you start investing, the more time compound interest has to work
            its magic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Be consistent.</strong> Regular contributions, even small ones, can significantly boost your returns
            over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reinvest your earnings.</strong> To fully benefit from compound interest, reinvest dividends,
            interest, and other returns rather than taking them as cash.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increase your contributions over time.</strong> As your income grows, try to increase how much
            you're saving and investing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Be patient.</strong> Compound interest works best over long periods. Avoid the temptation to
            withdraw your money early.
          </li>
        </ol>
